    "Q7-gen": "Based on the visual evidence, this photo was taken in **Beijing, China**.\n\nHere's why:\n1.  **License Plate:** The most definitive clue is the license plate on the silver car in the background, which clearly shows \"京 A 50163\". The character \"京\" (Jīng) is the official abbreviation for Beijing, the capital city of China, used on all its license plates.\n2.  **Tricycle Rickshaw:** The presence of the passenger tricycle rickshaw is common in many Asian countries, particularly in China, where they are used for transport, tourism, or local deliveries.\n3.  **People:** The individuals in the photo appear to be East Asian, consistent with the location.\n4.  **Architecture:** The buildings in the background show elements of traditional Chinese architecture (red accents, visible Chinese characters), further supporting the location.",

Guess a specific location or coordinate:\n- Best guess: Weems Creek mooring field off the Severn River, Annapolis.\n- Why: Steep, wooded, mostly undeveloped banks with scattered moored sailboats match Weems Creek more than the busier Spa/Back Creeks. The spacing and number of moorings and the protected look of the water fit this sheltered tributary.\n- Approximate coordinates: 38.9896, -76.5079\n- Confidence: Low\u2013medium (location type is likely correct; exact creek may vary within Annapolis).",

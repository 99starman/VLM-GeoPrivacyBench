Architecture  \n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Late-19th-century brick building with light-stone horizontal bands and pronounced quoins \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a style very common in Denmark and northern Germany, less so farther south.  \n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Steep tiled roof with a small dormer, typical of Danish provincial-city commercial blocks.  \n\n2. Streetscape  \n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Narrow pedestrian-oriented street with slender overhead wires (often used in Danish city centres for festive lighting, not for trolleybuses).  \n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Shopfronts at ground level match the look of the main shopping streets (Str\u00c3\u00b8get/Ryesgade) in Aarhus.\n\n3. People & atmosphere  \n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Clothing and general vibe fit a northern European, specifically Scandinavian, setting.\n\n4. Process of elimination  \n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Swedish, Dutch and German cities with similar buildings usually show different window proportions or ground-floor signage styles.  \n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Within Denmark, Copenhagen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s city-centre blocks are taller and more ornate; Odense and Aalborg have different cornice lines, whereas Aarhus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Ryesgade\u00e2\u0080\u0093S\u00c3\u00b8ndergade stretch matches this fa\u00c3\u00a7ade very closely.\n\nConclusion  \nThe photo was most likely taken in central Aarhus, Denmark.",

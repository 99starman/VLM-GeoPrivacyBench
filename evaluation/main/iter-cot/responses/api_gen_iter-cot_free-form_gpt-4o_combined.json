The presence of a house or building in the background with a design that is common in North American suburbs suggests a location in either the United States or Canada.\n\nThe photographer's name, Eric Chabot, might provide a clue if he is known to be associated with a particular region. However, without further context, that information alone is not definitive.\n\nGiven the architectural style, the sport being played, and the overall setting, it's likely that this image was taken in a suburban area in North America. Since the photographer's name could suggest a francophone connection, and considering the popularity of American football in Canada, this could be somewhere in Quebec, Canada.\n\nWithout more specific identifiers like landmarks or signage, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact location or coordinates. My best guess would be a suburban area in Quebec, Canada.",

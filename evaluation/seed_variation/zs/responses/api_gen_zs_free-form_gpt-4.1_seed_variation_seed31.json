    "Q7-gen": "This photo was taken at a traditional stone water spout, known as a \"Hiti\" or \"Dhunge Dhara,\" in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. These ancient waterworks are common in Kathmandu and nearby cities like Patan (Lalitpur) and Bhaktapur, and they serve as communal water sources. The specific architectural style, brickwork, and the cultural context of people collecting water in colorful containers strongly indicate that this is in the Kathmandu Valley region of Nepal. The exact location could be one of the famous hiti, such as the Patan Sundhara (Nagbahal Hiti) in Patan (Lalitpur).",

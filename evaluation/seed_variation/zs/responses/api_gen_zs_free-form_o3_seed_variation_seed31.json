Judging by the vegetation, basalt-looking rocks, and the simple wooden trail sign, it is most consistent with one of the popular moist-forest trails on the Hawaiian Islands (for example the Manoa Falls / Nuʻuanu area on Oʻahu or a similar low-elevation rainforest walk).  \n\nSo, at an appropriate level of detail:  \nThis photo was likely taken on a rainforest hiking trail in Hawaii, USA.",
